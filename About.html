    <h2>A Journey to Build, Explore & Inspire</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Emmanuel Adjei, born in December 1986 in Accra, Ghana. I am a 37-year-old proud Ghanaian and left
            for Germany in 2012 to pursue further education. I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Sports and Exercise Science
            from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and currently work as a sports scientist at my university’s
            hospital for sports medicine and sports cardiology.<br />Growing up in a sports-enthusiastic nation like
            Ghana, I excelled in athletics and became a proficient pole vaulter. My affinity for cycling began at age
            12, riding my father’s bicycle without permission. However, my new-found hobby was short-lived due to the
            lack of cycling infrastructure in Ghana. With time, I rekindled my passion for cycling in Munich, Germany
            where cycling enjoys a higher precedence among the city dwellers. Since 2020, I have expanded my cycling
            experiences to include road cycling and bikepacking, embarking on numerous adventures across Europe.</p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>Bike2myRoots is an innovative charity project by means of undertaking an epic cycling adventure across 2
            continents, Europe and Africa aimed at transforming the lives of underprivileged children in underserved and
            hard-to-reach communities in Ghana through education. This project leverages the physical, educational, and
            communal benefits of cycling to create lasting positive change.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This cycling project is not all about seeking the thrills of an adventure and fulfilling a dream. The saying
            “become the change you wish to see in the world” has inspired me and continues to fuel this project. This
            philosophy is deeply rooted in my passion and unwavering desire to use cycling as a tool to mobilize funds,
            support, and raise awareness for transforming lives in deprived communities in Ghana. In partnership with an
            impact-led non-governmental organization (NGO) EduSpots, this project will be used to raise funds and
            awareness to support EduSpots’ grassroots work in education in Ghana. EduSpots is a locally based NGO in
            Ghana with a global collaboration for community-led development through education. Through its community-led
            and sustainable approach, it transforms the educational opportunities of over 10,000 children and young
            adults in 50 underserved and hard-to-reach communities.</p>
        <ol>In summary this project aims to:
            <li><strong>Build</strong>: Join efforts in nation-building through grassroots engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Inspire</strong>: Lay a monumental foundation to inspire others to dream and achieve.</li>
            <li><strong>Explore</strong>: Provide a platform to experience and learn from diverse African cultures,
                food, hospitality, and people.</li>
        </ol>

            challenging, it is driven by my desire to transform the lives of children through education in deprived

            improving life in marginalized communities in Ghana and Africa. Join me on this epic journey, and together
